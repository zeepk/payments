frontend:
    src is where components and redux live (anything react)
    templates will handle the index.html (single page)
    static will be the compiled JS, 
        Webpack will take react application (index.js as entry point)
        compile it down to main.js inside static
	main.js is being loaded into index.html
    webpack.config.js allows us to use babel to transpile our code
	dev script takes index.html and displays it to main.js
